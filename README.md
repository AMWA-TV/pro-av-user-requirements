# JT-NM-ProAV-User-Requirements
User requirements for publicly developed ProAV standards

The initial user requirements were a contribution from the IPMX group of the Video Services Forum.

These requirements are owned and maintained by the AMWA.  The user requirements are a product of the Joint Task Force on Networked Media (JT-NM), a collaboration that is managed by the AMWA, the EBU the SMPTE and the VSF.

If you wish to submit a user requirement please submit a Pull Request.  An alternative way to do this is to raise an Issue in this repository.  Your submission will be reviewed by the JT-NM.  

We *strongly* prefer that you work through the appropriate committee of a JT-NM organization, such as the Audio Engineering Society (AES), the Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA), European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) or the Video Services Forum (VSF), to have your requirements vetted through that group rather than contributing directly to this repository.
