# JT-NM-ProAV-User-Requirements
The list of use requirments contained in this repository is maintained by the Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA) on behalf of the JT-NM, which owns the list.

The purpose of this list is to provide a common set of user requirements that coordinate the activities of JT-NM member organizations as they develop standards and specifications to serve the ProAV marketplace.

If you wish to submit a user requirement please submit a Pull Request. An alternative way to do this is to raise an Issue in this repository. Your submission will be reviewed by the JT-NM.

While it is possible for individuals to submit user stories to this repository, we *strongly* prefer that you work through the appropriate committee of a JT-NM organization, such as the Audio Engineering Society (AES), the Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) or the Video Services Forum (VSF), to have your requirements vetted by one of these organizations.
