# JT-NM-ProAV-User-Requirements
User requirements for publicly developed ProAV standards

The initial user requirements were a contribution from the IPMX group of the Video Services Forum.

These requirements are owned and maintained by the AMWA.  The user requirements are a product of the Joint Task Force on Networked Media (JT-NM), a collaboration that is managed by the AMWA, the EBU the SMPTE and the VSF.

If you wish to submit a user requirement please ideally submit a Pull Request.  An alternative way to do this is to raise an Issue in this repository.  Your submission will be reviewed by the JT-NM.
